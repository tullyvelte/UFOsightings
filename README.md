# UFOsightings

A custom Bootstrap website using Javascript to build and query a table of UFO sightings.

## Mission

The UFO sightings dataset is too large to search through manually. Code was needed to create a table dynamically, and allow users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. And it had to be done using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
